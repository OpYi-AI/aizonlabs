# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start development server at http://localhost:3000
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## Architecture Overview

This is a Next.js 14 AizonLabs landing page built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

### Key Structure

- **App Router**: Uses Next.js App Router with `app/` directory structure
- **Layout Pattern**: Root layout includes global Navbar, Footer, and ThemeProvider wrapper
- **Landing Page Components**: Modular landing page sections (Hero, Features, Testimonials, LeadForm, FAQ) composed in `app/page.tsx`
- **Theme System**: Dark/light mode toggle using `next-themes` with system preference detection
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable UI components in `/components` directory
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom utilities in `lib/utils.ts` using `clsx` and `tailwind-merge`

### Special Integrations

- **Cal.com Embed**: Integration via `@calcom/embed-react` with custom hook and modal system (see booking-button.tsx, booking-modal.tsx, inline-booking.tsx)
- **Supabase**: Database integration for lead form submissions via `utils/supabaseClient.ts`
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for page transitions and component animations
- **Icons**: Mix of Lucide React, Tabler Icons, and React Icons
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component with remote patterns configured for assets.aceternity.com and images.unsplash.com

### Cal.com Booking System

The booking system uses a modal-based approach:
- `BookingButton` triggers `BookingModal`
- `BookingModal` contains `InlineBooking` component
- Configuration stored in `constants/links.ts` (CALCOM_* constants)
- Cal.com script loaded via `CalScript` component in layout

### Import Aliases

Uses `@/*` path mapping to root directory for cleaner imports.
